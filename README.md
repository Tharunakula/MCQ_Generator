**Overview**

 Exam-style questions are a basic teaching tool that can be used for a variety of objectives. Questions have the capacity to influence student learning in addition to serving as an assessment tool. Learning tools are provided, and students can learn from a variety of online sources. The manual questions from the learning materials, on the other hand, are necessary for the learner’s assessment. To our knowledge, no generic assessment approach has been provided in the literature to evaluate learners’ learning gaps from e-reading documents. As a result, automated question production and evaluation methodologies can aid in the assessment system’s automation. Given a video lecture, our framework aims to find an effective way to extract summary out of it and generate MCQ’s.

**Purpose**
 
 The purpose of the project is to ease the hectic task of going through minute details of a video in order to generate Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) for various quizzes. The primary function of this project is to take in a video and generate high quality MCQs with four options from the provided video with the help of Natural Language Processing.

 **Scope**
 
This project is an effective way to generate questions using AI powered tools which is time efficient,reduces human intervention and cost effective technique when compared to traditional from based way for generation of MCQs. This will not only help teachers to assess but also students who are preparing for competitive exams or any other exams for analyzing their un-derstanding of the concepts
